# ShowDragDistance
Shows distance you've dragged the token as if you used the Ruler tool. Configurable to show path by default or hide it. Holding CTRL while dragging token hides/shows path based on what's opposite of default setting.

Rangefinder: With a single token selected, hold CTRL on the canvas and it will draw a ruler from token to mouse. Replaces need to CTRL + drag from token(you can still do that) Using the CTRL ruler shortcut unaffected as well.

Default ruler behaviour is unchanged.
