# ShowDragDistance
Shows distance you've dragged the token as if you used the Ruler tool. Right click to set waypoints. Press 'X' to delete waypoints. 

Rangefinder: With a single token selected, hold CTRL on the canvas and it will draw a ruler from token to mouse. Replaces need to CTRL + drag from token(you can still do that) Using the CTRL ruler shortcut unaffected as well.

Default ruler behaviour is unchanged.
